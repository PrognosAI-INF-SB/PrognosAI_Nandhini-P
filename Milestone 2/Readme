Milestone 2: Model Development & Training
Objective
Develop and train a time-series deep learning model (LSTM/GRU) capable of learning patterns from sensor data to predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL).​

Deliverables

Implemented LSTM or GRU model architecture.​

Trained model weights.​

Training loss and validation loss curves.​

Code for model definition, training, and saving.​

Evaluation Criteria

Convergence of the training process (loss reduction).​

Initial performance on the validation set (e.g., visual inspection of predicted vs. actual RUL).​

Proper implementation of the deep learning model.
