Milestone 3: Model Evaluation & Performance Assessment
Objective
   Rigorously evaluate the trained model's performance using quantitative metrics and analyze predictive accuracy.​

Deliverables
   Calculated RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) scores for the test set.​
   Plots comparing predicted RUL against actual RUL.​
   Analytical report discussing model biases, errors, and overall performance.​
   Documentation of evaluation procedures.​

Evaluation Criteria
    RMSE scores meet or are below predefined thresholds for acceptable accuracy.​
    Visual consistency between predicted and actual RUL curves.​
    In-depth identification and analysis of model limitations and sources of error.​
    Comprehensive evaluation documentation.​

Milestone 4: Risk Thresholding & Alert System

Objective
  Define and implement a mechanism to translate RUL model predictions into actionable maintenance alerts.​

Deliverables
   Clearly defined RUL thresholds for different alert levels (e.g., warning, critical).​
   Code logic for triggering maintenance alerts based on predicted RUL.​
   Documentation with examples of triggered alerts across different scenarios.​
   Algorithm description for alert generation.​

Evaluation Criteria
     Effectiveness of thresholds in early identification of potential failures.​
     Clarity and accuracy of alert triggers in representing maintenance risks.​
     Practical usability and applicability of the alerting system in real-world settings.​
     Transparent documentation of the alert mechanism.
