Milestone 3: Model Evaluation & Performance Assessment
Objective
   Rigorously evaluate the trained model's performance using quantitative metrics and analyze predictive accuracy.​

Deliverables
   Calculated RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) scores for the test set.​
   Plots comparing predicted RUL against actual RUL.​
   Analytical report discussing model biases, errors, and overall performance.​
   Documentation of evaluation procedures.​

Evaluation Criteria
    RMSE scores meet or are below predefined thresholds for acceptable accuracy.​
    Visual consistency between predicted and actual RUL curves.​
    In-depth identification and analysis of model limitations and sources of error.​
    Comprehensive evaluation documentation.​
