Milestone 4: Risk Thresholding & Alert System

Objective
  Define and implement a mechanism to translate RUL model predictions into actionable maintenance alerts.​

Deliverables
   Clearly defined RUL thresholds for different alert levels (e.g., warning, critical).​
   Code logic for triggering maintenance alerts based on predicted RUL.​
   Documentation with examples of triggered alerts across different scenarios.​
   Algorithm description for alert generation.​

Evaluation Criteria
     Effectiveness of thresholds in early identification of potential failures.​
     Clarity and accuracy of alert triggers in representing maintenance risks.​
     Practical usability and applicability of the alerting system in real-world settings.​
     Transparent documentation of the alert mechanism.
