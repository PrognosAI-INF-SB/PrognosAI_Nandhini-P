Milestone 3: Model Evaluation & Performance Assessment
Objective:
   Rigorously evaluate the trained time-series deep learning model's performance using defined metrics and analyze its predictive accuracy.​

Key Deliverables:
   Calculated RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) scores for the test set.​
   Plots comparing predicted Remaining Useful Life (RUL) against actual RUL values.​
   Analysis of model biases and error sources.​
   A detailed evaluation report covering strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations.​

Evaluation Criteria:
   Achieve an acceptable RMSE score (e.g., below a predefined threshold).​
   Ensure visual consistency between predicted and actual RUL plots.​
   Identify and explain model limitations or areas for future improvement
